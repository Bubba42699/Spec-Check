                        From humble comic book beginnings to becoming one of the most successful film franchises in history, Marvel has completely revolutionized the way we experience superhero stories. But the MCU is more than just superheroes saving the world. It’s a universe full of mind-bending time travel, epic battles, complex characters, and jaw-dropping plot twists. But how did Marvel go from comics to creating a multi-billion-dollar universe? Let's dive in!</p>

                    <p>The Birth of a Cinematic Revolution: <br>

                        In 2008, when Marvel Studios released Iron Man, who could have predicted what would unfold next? A character who was relatively unknown to casual movie-goers became the cornerstone of a sprawling, interconnected universe. Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., set the stage for what would become known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The post-credit scene teasing Nick Fury and the Avengers Initiative was not just a hint—it was a declaration. Marvel wasn't just telling a single story; they were building something monumental.</p>

                        <p>Connecting the Dots: <br> A Web of Interconnected Stories

                            The MCU isn’t just a series of films; it’s a tapestry of interconnected stories that come together in a way that was previously unheard of in modern cinema. It’s like a chessboard—every movie is a move, setting the stage for future triumphs and betrayals.
                            
                            From The Avengers assembling for the first time to Infinity War’s devastating snap, the stakes kept getting higher and higher. It’s easy to see why fans were hooked—each film carried weight, and every detail mattered.
                            
                            And let’s talk about those post-credit scenes! If you’ve ever sat through the credits, you know the feeling of pure anticipation. These little teasers and Easter eggs made the MCU feel like one giant, interconnected puzzle. It was like a treasure hunt for fans who lived for those "Aha!" moments.</p>
